The goal of {charcuterie} is to finally have strings as iterable
character vectors.

## Installation

You can install the published version from CRAN with

``` r
install.packages("charcuterie")
```

You can install the development version with

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jonocarroll/charcuterie")
```

## Motivation

See this blog post:
<https://jcarroll.com.au/2024/08/03/charcuterie-what-if-strings-were-iterable-in-r/>

Most programming languages seem to treat a string as an array of
characters, but not R, where a “string” is an object of type “character”
which has a length of 1. The number of ‘characters’ in a string is
obtained via `nchar(x)` but otherwise, the individual ‘characters’
comprising the string are rarely exposed.

The most common route around this limitation is to split the string into
smaller strings, each containing a single character, i.e.

``` r
strsplit("string", split = "")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "s" "t" "r" "i" "n" "g"
```

which produces a list of strings, each a single character. This is
cumbersome to type out, so this package offers a cleaner approach (which
does the above all the same)

``` r
library(charcuterie)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'charcuterie'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, union
s <- chars("string")
s
#> [1] "string"
```

This *looks like* it did nothing, but that’s the point - it still looks
like a “string”. It’s actually a vector, though

``` r
unclass(s)
#> [1] "s" "t" "r" "i" "n" "g"
```

## Example Usage

This means you can finally do vector things with it, like reverse it

``` r
rev(s)
#> [1] "gnirts"
```

or sort it

``` r
sort(s)
#> [1] "ginrst"
```

or index into it

``` r
s[3]
#> [1] "r"
```

{charcuterie} defines S3 methods of functions for a wide range of
operations to be performed on a string built from a vector of characters

- index with `[`
- concatenate with `c`
- print with `format` and `print`
- slice with `head` and `tail`
- reverse with `rev`
- sort with `sort`
- set operations with `setdiff`, `union`, `intersect`, and a new
  `except`
- leverage existing vectorised operations like `unique`, `toupper`, and
  `tolower`

For more detailed usage examples, see the vignettes.
